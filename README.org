* Introduction
* [[https://dhall-lang.org][Dhall]] configuration
** Introduction
   The feeds and urls are declared using the [[https://dhall-lang.org][Dhall]] configuration language
   and its implementation in rust.
   This is a great configuration since we can then create
   community lists of feeds to be included in dhall automatically.
** Channel source

The main =rss= source item can have the following fields

| Field | Type     | Optional |
|-------+----------+----------|
| url   | string   | no       |
| name  | string   | no       |
| tags  | [string] | no       |
| cmd   | String   | yes      |

In =dhall=, this can be translated in the following type

#+begin_src dhall :tangle urrss.dhall :comments both
{ Type =
    { url : Optional Text, name : Text, cmd : Optional Text, tags : List Text }
, default = { cmd = None Text } âˆ§ { tags = [] : List Text }
}
#+end_src

The equivalent in Rust will therefore be a simple struct

#+begin_src rust :tangle src/source.rs :comments both
extern crate serde;

#[derive(Debug, serde::Deserialize)]
pub struct Source {
    pub name: String,
    pub url: Option<String>,
    pub cmd: Option<String>,
    pub tags: Vec<String>,
}
#+end_src

* Maildir format
  In order to understand how the program should transform
  the =rss= sources, we need to understand first the =maildir=
  format

  A =maildir= is composed of three folders,
  - new ::
    This is where newly received messages are stored by the
    Mail User Agent. In our case, we will create files
    in this directory.
  - cur :: 
    This is where non-new messages are stored.
    =cur= will be ignored by us.
  - tmp ::
    This is a transit zone for messages in the process of being
    received. =tmp= will be ignored by us.

** Basic mail headers

A message will look like this in =ur-rss=

#+begin_src mail
